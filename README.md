📄 Smart Resume Screener
📚 Project Overview
The Smart Resume Screener is a full-stack, AI-powered platform that automates resume analysis and matching against job descriptions.
It uses advanced NLP techniques, semantic search, text similarity models, and Spring Boot microservices to generate detailed ATS-style fit scores, skill matches, and candidate summaries.

🔵 Important:
While OpenAI is used only for final summary generation (strengths/weaknesses), the core analysis — including skill extraction, experience calculation, education parsing, and semantic scoring — is fully built using custom NLP and ML models (spaCy, Sentence-Transformers, TF-IDF).

⚙️ Project Architecture

Component	Tech Stack	Hosting
Frontend	React.js (Vite + Axios)	Vercel
Backend	Spring Boot	Render
AI Microservice	FastAPI + spaCy + Sentence-Transformers + OpenAI (for summary only)	Render
Database	PostgreSQL	Render
🖥️ Frontend (React.js)
Framework: React.js + Axios

Deployment: Vercel

Features:

Upload resumes and job descriptions

View ATS fit score, matched skills, experience, education

Real-time dashboard updates via WebSocket

Beautiful charts and popover summaries

🏗️ Backend (Spring Boot)
Authentication:

JWT-based signup/login

Resume Upload:

Receives resume + job description from frontend

Forwards them to the AI Microservice for analysis

Database:

Stores analysis and candidate information in PostgreSQL

WebSocket:

Broadcasts real-time analysis updates to dashboard

Dockerized:

Lightweight production Docker build

🐳 Dockerfile for Spring Boot Backend

🧠 AI Microservice (FastAPI)
Framework: FastAPI

Main Analysis Done By:

spaCy NLP: Entity Recognition (Skills, Contact, Education)

SkillNER: Deep skill extraction

Sentence-Transformers: Semantic similarity between resume & JD

TF-IDF: Text-based keyword similarity

OpenAI GPT-4o-mini:

Used only to generate candidate summaries and strengths/weaknesses based on already extracted information.

Security:

CORS middleware enabled

🛠️ Core AI/NLP Technologies

Library	Usage
spaCy (en_core_web_md)	Resume entity extraction
SkillNER	Deep skill extraction from text
Sentence-Transformers (all-mpnet-base-v2)	Semantic similarity scoring
TF-IDF (scikit-learn)	Text keyword matching
OpenAI GPT-4o-mini	Summary + strengths/weaknesses generation ONLY (post-analysis)
🚀 Full System Workflow
User uploads resume + job description via frontend.

Backend sends the files to AI Microservice for deep NLP analysis.

AI Service:

Parses education, experience, and contact info.

Extracts and normalizes skills.

Calculates ATS fit score (semantic + TF-IDF + skill + experience + education).

Calls OpenAI only after scoring to generate human-readable summaries.

Backend saves analysis result to PostgreSQL.

Frontend updates dashboard in real-time using WebSocket and displays rich visualizations.
